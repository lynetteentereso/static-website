                                <p>I am Elisabeth Brothers and I am an owner of a real estate investment company / Licensed Realtor and top producing agent of <a id="red" href="https://www.occupyrealestategroup.com/" target="_blank">Occupy Real Estate Group</a>. I have lived in Florida since 2015 and have called Jacksonville, Florida my home and a place for my husband, chihuahua, and our English bulldog.</p><br>
                                <p>My husband is a native of Florida and we are excited about living here in North Florida. We enjoy the people, seasons, culture, and many outdoor activities available to us.</p><br>
                                <p>In my practice of Real Estate, I am well known for great customer service, consistent communication, strong attention to detail and ensuring a positive experience for all parties in a transaction: Buyers, Sellers, Cooperating Agents.</p><br>
                                <p>Many other agents I have worked with do not share my same paradigm which has made it a priority for me to ensure a better way. My approach to any transaction is this, <quote>“It is about the people, not the agent”</quote>. For the past 2 years I have helped over 35 families in the Jacksonville community through transactions and making the buying or selling experience positive and seamless!</p><br>
